    "I fell in love with you the very first day we spoke personally. That moment still feels so vivid in my heart, as if it happened just yesterday. I remember messaging you with a mix of nervousness and hope, not knowing if you would reply. But deep down, I believed that you would, and when you did, it felt like my world suddenly became brighter.

    It’s amazing how life works—your brother’s birthday being the very next day after our first conversation felt like destiny giving me a chance, a door opening that I couldn’t afford to let slip away. From that moment, every word we exchanged felt like it carried so much meaning, and I realized just how special you were to me.That was the day my life truly changed, and I’ve cherished every moment since then."<span style="color: red !important;">❤️</span></p>
